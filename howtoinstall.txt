Go into ox_inventory
Look inside of item.txt
  And put those inside of your items.lua file in ox_inventory
Then go into the imgs file in my script and take all of those imgs and drop them into your ox_inventory/web/imgs
  NOTE!!!! IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IPHONE ITEM DO NOT PUT iphone.png INTO THE IMGS FOLDER ALSO DO NOT!! PUT IT IN THE items.lua FILES!
